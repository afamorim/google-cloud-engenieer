# 3. Deploying and implementing a cloud solution

## 3.1 Deploying and implementing Compute Engine resources. Tasks include:

- Launching a compute instance using Cloud Console and Cloud SDK (gcloud) (e.g., assign disks, availability policy, SSH keys)
- Creating an autoscaled managed instance group using an instance template
- Generating/uploading a custom SSH key for instances
- Configuring a VM for Stackdriver monitoring and logging

### Assessing compute quotas and requesting increases

- It's possible to atach the up to 24 ssds devices in a vm instance.

- To use ssh by command use `gcloud compute ssh <USER>@<INSTANCE_HOST>`

### Installing the Stackdriver Agent for monitoring and logging

## 3.2 Deploying and implementing Google Kubernetes Engine resources. Tasks include:

- Deploying a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster
- Deploying a container application to Google Kubernetes Engine using pods
- Configuring Google Kubernetes Engine application monitoring and logging

## 3.3 Deploying and implementing App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions resources. Tasks include, where applicable:

### 3.3.1 App Engine

- TimeOut: 1 minute
- You can get 28 hours of free auomatic scalling quota of 28 hours for front end applications
- You can get 9 hours of free auomatic scalling quota of 28 hours for back end applications

### 3.3.2 Cloud Run

To execute cloud run it required the initiation of these three services:

- Coud Run
- Cloud Build
- Cloud Container

Cloud run can be splited in Cloud Run and Cloud Run for Anthos. The difference betteen then are

- Cloud Run for Anthos supports GKE
- Cloud Run does not require GKE support in a fully managed setting.
- Cloud run can use customized libraries

Command to build with gcloud:

`gcloud builds submit --tag gcr.io/<project-id>/<application-name>`

TimeOut: 15 minutes

### 3.3.3 Cloud Functions

Languages that can be used

- NodeJs
- Python
- Go
- .Net
- Java
- Ruby
- PHP

Events can trigger functions.

The events type:

- Cloud Storage
- Cloud Pub/sub
- Http
- Firebase
- Monitoring Loggin

Command to use functions:

- Deploy: `gcloud functions deploy <name> --entry-point <program-entry-point> --runtime <runtime> <trigger>`
- Reading logs: `gcloud functions logs read --limit 10`
- Delete: `gcloud functions delete <function-name>`

Timeout: 9 minutes

### To Calculate price using google function you have to considerate these parameters

- Type, Bandwidth, execution time and invocations

## 3.4 Deploying and implementing data solutions. Tasks include

### Initializing data systems with products (e.g., Cloud SQL, Cloud Datastore, BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Storage)

### Loading data (e.g., command line upload, API transfer, import/export, load data from Cloud Storage, streaming data to Cloud Pub/Sub)

## 3.5 Deploying and implementing networking resources. Tasks include:

Creating a VPC with subnets (e.g., custom-mode VPC, shared VPC)
Launching a Compute Engine instance with custom network configuration (e.g., internal-only IP address, Google private access, static external and private IP address, network tags)

### Creating ingress and egress firewall rules for a VPC (e.g., IP subnets, tags, service accounts)

- For list firewall rules for an especific network is `gcloud compute firewall-rules list --filter network=<NETWORK_NAME>`

### Creating a VPN between a Google VPC and an external network using Cloud VPN

### Creating a load balancer to distribute application network traffic to an application (e.g., Global HTTP(S) load balancer, Global SSL Proxy load balancer, Global TCP Proxy load balancer, regional network load balancer, regional internal load balancer)

- Network Load Balancing to load balance UDP, TCP and SSL traffic on ports that are nor supported the TCP proxy and SSL Proxy Load balancers
- Internal TCP/UDP load balancer are available with region and not globally

## 3.6 Deploying a solution using Cloud Marketplace. Tasks include:

Command to list deployments:

`gcloud deployment-manager deployments list`

## 3.7 Deploying application infrastructure using Cloud Deployment Manager. Tasks include:

- Developing Deployment Manager templates
- Launching a Deployment Manager template
