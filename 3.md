# 3. Deploying and implementing a cloud solution

### 3.1 Deploying and implementing Compute Engine resources. Tasks include:

Launching a compute instance using Cloud Console and Cloud SDK (gcloud) (e.g., assign disks, availability policy, SSH keys)
Creating an autoscaled managed instance group using an instance template
Generating/uploading a custom SSH key for instances
Configuring a VM for Stackdriver monitoring and logging
Assessing compute quotas and requesting increases
Installing the Stackdriver Agent for monitoring and logging

### 3.2 Deploying and implementing Google Kubernetes Engine resources. Tasks include:

Deploying a Google Kubernetes Engine cluster
Deploying a container application to Google Kubernetes Engine using pods
Configuring Google Kubernetes Engine application monitoring and logging

### 3.3 Deploying and implementing App Engine, Cloud Run, and Cloud Functions resources. Tasks include, where applicable:

#### 3.3.1 App Engine

#### 3.3.2 Cloud Run

Cloud run can be splited in Cloud Run and Cloud Run for Anthos. The difference betteen then are

- Cloud Run can use customized libraries

Command to build with gcloud:
`gcloud builds subdmit --tag gcr.io/<project-id>/<application-name>`

#### 3.3.3 Cloud Functions

Deploying an application, updating scaling configuration, versions, and traffic splitting
Deploying an application that receives Google Cloud events (e.g., Cloud Pub/Sub events, Cloud Storage object change notification events)

#### 3.4 Deploying and implementing data solutions. Tasks include:

Initializing data systems with products (e.g., Cloud SQL, Cloud Datastore, BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Pub/Sub, Cloud Bigtable, Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Dataflow, Cloud Storage)
Loading data (e.g., command line upload, API transfer, import/export, load data from Cloud Storage, streaming data to Cloud Pub/Sub)

### 3.5 Deploying and implementing networking resources. Tasks include:

Creating a VPC with subnets (e.g., custom-mode VPC, shared VPC)
Launching a Compute Engine instance with custom network configuration (e.g., internal-only IP address, Google private access, static external and private IP address, network tags)
Creating ingress and egress firewall rules for a VPC (e.g., IP subnets, tags, service accounts)
Creating a VPN between a Google VPC and an external network using Cloud VPN
Creating a load balancer to distribute application network traffic to an application (e.g., Global HTTP(S) load balancer, Global SSL Proxy load balancer, Global TCP Proxy load balancer, regional network load balancer, regional internal load balancer)

### 3.6 Deploying a solution using Cloud Marketplace. Tasks include:

Browsing Cloud Marketplace catalog and viewing solution details
Deploying a Cloud Marketplace solution

### 3.7 Deploying application infrastructure using Cloud Deployment Manager. Tasks include:

Developing Deployment Manager templates
Launching a Deployment Manager template
