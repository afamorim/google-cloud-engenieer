# 4. Ensuring successful operation of a cloud solution

## 4.1 Managing Compute Engine resources. Tasks include

Managing a single VM instance (e.g., start, stop, edit configuration, or delete an instance)
SSH/RDP to the instance
Attaching a GPU to a new instance and installing CUDA libraries

### Viewing current running VM inventory (instance IDs, details)

- GCE is not a managed service hence auto scaling is set up manually using managed instance group

### Working with snapshots (e.g., create a snapshot from a VM, view snapshots, delete a snapshot)

- If take an snapshot from running vm's it's possible that some files could be corrupted.

Working with images (e.g., create an image from a VM or a snapshot, view images, delete an image)
Working with instance groups (e.g., set autoscaling parameters, assign instance template, create an instance template, remove instance group)
Working with management interfaces (e.g., Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, GCloud SDK)

## 4.2 Managing Google Kubernetes Engine resources. Tasks include

Viewing current running cluster inventory (nodes, pods, services)
Browsing the container image repository and viewing container image details

### Working with node pools (e.g., add, edit, or remove a node pool)

- To resize the number of nodes the command is `gcloud container cluster resize <NAME> --num-nodes=<NUMBER>`

Working with pods (e.g., add, edit, or remove pods)
Working with services (e.g., add, edit, or remove a service)
Working with stateful applications (e.g. persistent volumes, stateful sets)
Working with management interfaces (e.g., Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK)

## 4.3 Managing App Engine and Cloud Run resources. Tasks include

Adjusting application traffic splitting parameters
Setting scaling parameters for autoscaling instances
Working with management interfaces (e.g., Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK)

## 4.4 Managing storage and database solutions. Tasks include

### Moving objects between Cloud Storage buckets

- If it's enabled object verion of a cloud storage service, the first version of an object uploaded is 1

- That command will output details about an object `gsutil stats gs://<GS_NAME>/OBJECT_NAME`

### Converting Cloud Storage buckets between storage classes

- The command to change the classes of an object is `gsutil rewrite -s <NEW_CLASSES_NAME> gs://<GS_NAME>/<OBJECT_NAME>`

### Setting object life cycle management policies for Cloud Storage buckets

Executing queries to retrieve data from data instances (e.g., Cloud SQL, BigQuery, Cloud Spanner, Cloud Datastore, Cloud Bigtable)
Estimating costs of a BigQuery query
Backing up and restoring data instances (e.g., Cloud SQL, Cloud Datastore)
Reviewing job status in Cloud Dataproc, Cloud Dataflow, or BigQuery
Working with management interfaces (e.g., Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK)

## 4.5 Managing networking resources. Tasks include

- To stabilish hign bandwith between you google cloud VPC's Network and your on premises infrastructure let's use Interconnect.

Adding a subnet to an existing VPC
Expanding a subnet to have more IP addresses
Reserving static external or internal IP addresses
Working with management interfaces (e.g., Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK)

## 4.6 Monitoring and logging. Tasks include

- To implement helthschecks Stackdriver monitoring

Creating Stackdriver alerts based on resource metrics
Creating Stackdriver custom metrics
Configuring log sinks to export logs to external systems (e.g., on-premises or BigQuery)
Viewing and filtering logs in Stackdriver
Viewing specific log message details in Stackdriver
Using cloud diagnostics to research an application issue (e.g., viewing Cloud Trace data, using Cloud Debug to view an application point-in-time)
Viewing Google Cloud Platform status
Working with management interfaces (e.g., Cloud Console, Cloud Shell, Cloud SDK)
